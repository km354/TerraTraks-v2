# GitHub Auto-Commit Setup

## ✅ What's Already Configured

- ✅ Automatic commit hook (commits are made automatically)
- ✅ Helper script for manual commits: `./scripts/commit-and-push.sh`
- ✅ Post-commit hook attempts to push automatically

## 🔐 Setting Up Authentication

For automatic pushes to work, you need to set up GitHub authentication. Choose one method:

### Option 1: GitHub Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Generate a new token with `repo` permissions
3. Run:
   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper store
   ```
4. On first push, enter your username and use the token as the password

### Option 2: SSH Keys

1. Generate SSH key (if you don't have one):
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
2. Add to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
3. Change remote to SSH:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:km354/TerraTraks-v2.git
   ```

### Option 3: GitHub CLI

```bash
brew install gh
gh auth login
```

## 🚀 How It Works Now

- **Automatic commits**: After any changes, commits are made automatically
- **Automatic push**: The post-commit hook tries to push (requires auth)
- **Manual push**: If auto-push fails, run `git push origin main` manually

## 📝 Commits Are Always Saved Locally

Even if pushes fail, all your changes are committed locally and safe. You can push manually later.
